## Project Management with Linear, GraphQL, and Things

This project aims to optimize my current workflow of project management where my work is distributed across multiple workspaces in Linear. By utilizing their API, I can create two unified views for the collection of issues for my upcoming projects, **Yale Visual Artists Dot Com** and **Kris Aziabor Dot Com**.

### Workspaces in Linear

Containing issues rooted in "cycles"/sprints, Linear is the foundation for my project management system. However, the tasks and issues are spread across multiple workspaces and Linear offers no support/functionality for viewing them alltogether.

### Linear's API w/ GraphQL

Using their API, I can now create a consolidated database where all issues and tasks can be viewed across workspaces. With the mutations the Linear API offers, I can also edit the state of issues and sprints using a GraphQL backend.

### Next.js frontend, living in back page of *Kris Aziabor Dot Com*

The final destination of this work will be a back page of my personal website, where depending on the viewer, they can either view/& edit the collection of issues and the past, current, and upcoming sprint/cycle.

### Things URL Scheme

Things, a task management app by Cultured Code, has their own remote management of tasks using a URL Scheme that I will link to my database. This way, I will have an on-prem view of the issues using the incredibly strong GUI they have curated. The dual existence of this GUI and the website functionality will give me online and offline access to this project management automation system.
